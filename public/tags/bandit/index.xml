      <description>Task Find the only file that respect these requirements and read its content.
The requirements are:
human-readable 1033 bytes in size not executable Login SSH: bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
Theory To solve this task, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a combination of basic Linux commands to search for and identify the file with the specified properties. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down the key commands we&amp;rsquo;ll be using:
find Command
The find command in Linux is a powerful tool that allows users to search for files and directories based on various criteria.</description>

      <guid>https://kaliban2056.github.io/posts/overthewire-bandit-4-5/</guid>
      <description>Task Find the only human-readable file inside the inhere directory.
Login SSH: bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
Theory To find what file is human-readable we can check the type of data inside the file. To do that we can use the file command, some examples would be: ASCII text, directory, POSIX tar archive. Trying to read a non human-readable file would show something like this in the output l�����]�a߯-@gQ�÷�wz�P�ߠy�.
Solution SSH in to the remote host again and go to the inhere directory.</description>

      <description>Task Find and read the content of the hidden file in the inhere directory.
Login SSH: bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
Theory To find an hidden file in a linux filesystem is really easy, we can use the ls command to list every file in the directory adding to it the -a attribute to list hidden files too. They are commonly used for storing user preferences or preserving the state of a utility and are frequently created implicitly by using various utilities.</description>

      <title>Over The Wire - Bandit 2 -&gt; 3</title>
      <link>https://kaliban2056.github.io/posts/overthewire-bandit-2-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 17:51:53 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kaliban2056.github.io/posts/overthewire-bandit-2-3/</guid>
      <description>Task Read the content of the file called &amp;ldquo;spaces in this filename&amp;rdquo;.
Login SSH: bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
Theory We can&amp;rsquo;t read a file that has a space in its filename normally. To read it we can simply put the name of the file between quotes &amp;quot;filname&amp;quot; and then we can read it.
Solution Log in to the remote host with the credentials from the last level. ~$: ssh bandit2@bandit.</description>

      <guid>https://kaliban2056.github.io/posts/overthewire-bandit-1-2/</guid>
      <description>Task Read the content of the file called &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo;
Login SSH: bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
Theory To read a file with an &amp;ldquo;unconventional name&amp;rdquo; such as - we need to use the path of the file ./.
Solution We log in to the remote host with the right credentials ~$: ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 Search for the file and read it. bandit1@bandit~$: ls - bandit1@bandit~$: cat ./- 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx We can now proceed to the next challenge.</description>

      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 19:51:15 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kaliban2056.github.io/posts/overthewire-bandit-0-1/</guid>
      <description>Task Find the file readme stored in the filesystem.
Login SSH: bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: bandit0
Theory After loggin in the remote host you can use a set of commands to understand where are you and what files are in your directory:
pwd this command show the name of the working directory, the directory you&amp;rsquo;re in right now. ls list the files in the current folder, you can add the attribute -a to show hidden files, using -l instead will show additional information on the files.</description>

      <description>Introduction OverTheWire is a free online platform “to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games”. It has different, so-called “Wargames”, that deal each deal with an area of security.
The first game that is recommended is called Bandit. It is recommended first because it teaches “the basics needed to be able to play other wargames”. This includes mainly basic Linux and Git commands.
I worked through the levels and decided to write a walkthrough for my blog.</description>
