# Introduction

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is an online platform that provides a series of interactive war games designed to teach and challenge users in various aspects of cybersecurity, programming, and systems administration. These war games cover a diverse range of topics, from basic Linux command line usage to complex cryptography and network exploitation techniques.

# Bandit 0

## Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`, on port `2220`. The username is `bandit0` and the password is `bandit0`.

## Theory

1. Introduction to SSH:
    - Definition: SSH or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure data communication, remote command-line login, and other secure network services between two networked computers.
    - Purpose: It ensures that the data sent over the network is encrypted, providing confidentiality and integrity of data and secure authentication.
2. Understanding SSH Authentication:
    - Authentication mechanisms: SSH supports various authentication methods, including password-based authentication, public key authentication and host based authentication. For this level, the focus is on password-based authentication.
    - Process: WHen using password-based authentication, the client provides a username and password, which the server verifies. If the credentials are correct, access is granted.
3. Connecting to a Remote Host Using SSH:
    - Basic Command Structure: The basic syntax for connection to a remote host via SSH is:
    ```bash
    ssh [username]@[hostname] -p [port]
    ```
    - Parameters:
        - `username`: The username you are logging in with.
        - `hostname`: The remote hostâ€™s address (in this case, bandit.labs.overthewire.org).
        - `port`: The port number to connect to (in this case, 2220).
4. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting:
    - Incorrect Credentials: Ensure that you are using the correct username and password. Typos can lead to authentication failures.
    - Firewall and Network Issues: Ensure that your network allows outbound connections on port `2220`. If you are behind a restrictive firewall, you might need to adjust your network settings.

## Solution

To solve this level simply SSH into the remote host with the credentials given in the level goal and find the password for the next level.

```
~$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

~$ ls
