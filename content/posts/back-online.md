Hello everyone,

After taking a break from the blog, I’m back and ready to dive into new content. During the time away, I focused on expanding my skillset—learning Go (Golang) and working on various projects while also navigating the job market.

Now that I’m back, I plan to resume regular posts, while also sharing insights from the projects I’ve been working on. You can expect:

-   Continued coverage of cybersecurity like over the wire and stuff like that
-   Project highlights and technical breakdowns

Thanks for your patience. Looking forward to sharing more soon.
