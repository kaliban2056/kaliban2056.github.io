# Hi, I'm Kaliban
a passionate computer science enthusiast with a broad interest in technology. My journey includes programming, penetration testing, networking, and self-hosting, with a current focus on mastering the Rust programming language. I’m deeply involved in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, which fuel my curiosity and drive to solve complex security problems. I predominantly use GNU/Linux systems, particularly Arch Linux, and am a strong advocate for Free Open Source Software and decentralized networks like Tor and P2P. I believe these technologies are crucial for enhancing privacy and security in today’s digital landscape. Through this blog, I share my experiences, insights, and practical advice on these topics, aiming to provide valuable content for tech enthusiasts and professionals seeking to navigate and innovate in the ever-evolving world of technology.
